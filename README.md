eWaterLeaf
======================

Copyright 2014 The Netherlands eScience Center

Last modified: 6 June 2014


Description
-----------

eWaterLeaf is a simple web-based visualization for the eWaterCycle project. It relies heavily on the [Leaflet](www.leaflet.com) Javascript library, and [ncWMS](http://www.resc.rdg.ac.uk/trac/ncWMS/) Web Map Service implementation.

eWaterLeaf mostly serves as an exploration tool for the data generated by the PCRGLOB-WB model used in the eWaterCycle project, but it should work with any dataset compatible with ncWMS (NetCDF-CF files).
